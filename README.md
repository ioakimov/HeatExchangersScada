Old project in which I developed UI-components for SCADA of heat station using C#/WPF, Blender(for some 3D models).
Library contains of such components: pump, pipe, valve, heat exchanger.
From these components we can assemble any schema.
Please note that animation of each component in the schema depends on state of previous component(and we don't have to write additional logic for that)
For example working pump become red(danger) when we close water stream before it.
